# VitaVault

**VitaVault** is an all-in-one backup utility for the PlayStation Vita, designed to make data preservation simple, fast, and highly customizable. Whether you want to back up save games, trophies, licenses, or specific custom folders, VitaVault provides the tools you need with a native GPU-accelerated interface.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**USE THIS TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

VitaVault is installed as an **UNSAFE** homebrew and requires extended permissions to access system partitions (such as `ur0:`, `vd0:`, `tm0:`, etc.). Modifying or restoring system files carries a risk of bricking your console or losing sensitive data. 

The author is not responsible for any damage to your hardware or software, data loss, or "bricks" resulting from the use of this application. Always ensure you have a fallback and understand what you are backing up or restoring.
